# Peerim-Modlist
A modlist for Peeve

Please read this document thoroughly before installing this modlist. If you skip a step, you may encounter errors when you try to run your game. 
This modlist was built using Wabbajack. To install it on your machine, you must first download Wabbajack here: 
https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you are able to, please support the Wabbajack developers on their patreon:

Once you have Wabbajack installed and the .wabbajack file downloaded from this github, open Wabbajack, and select "install from drive". There are multiple fields here. First, "Target Modlist" should be pointed towards Peerim.wabbajack. "Modlist Installation Location" should be an empty folder. Wabbajack will wipe any files that may be in the folder already, so BE SURE THIS IS AN EMPTY FOLDER. "Resource Download Location" should be filled out by wabbajack automatically. Once these are filled out, press the play button. Wabbajack will begin downloading the modlist. A browser window will open and you must click download for each mod (unfortunately the only way to automate this process is to pay for a nexus premium account). 

A few mods must be manually installed:
Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64): https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379
SKSE Engine Fixes Part 2: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230?tab=files&file_id=181171

Install for these mods are simple. You cann follow the installation instructions on nexus, but in short:
Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64): Open the archive with 7zip or your preferred archive manager. There should be a root folder in the archive, go into this folder if it is present. Take all of the files and folders from this archive and drag and drop them into your Skyrim Special Edition folder on steam. 

SKSE Engine Fixes Part 2: Open the archive with 7zip or your preferred archive manager. Take all of the .dll files from this archive and drag and drop them into your Skyrim Special Edition folder on steam.
