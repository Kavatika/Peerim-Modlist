# Peerim Anniversary Edition
A modlist for Peeve and Peeverts

Please read this document thoroughly before installing this modlist. If you skip a step, you may encounter errors when you try to run your game. 

This mod is built specifically for Skyrim Anniversary Edition. You must have all creation club content that came with Anniversary Edition installed. Some mods rely on/modify Creation Club content and the game may be unstable if you do not have them. 

**It is strongly advised to start with a fresh install.** If you have mods in your Skyrim folder already, back them up to another folder, then uninstall Skyrim. **Go back to your Skyrim folder and delete any files that remain.** Then reinstall Skyrim and launch it. Configure graphics settings if need be. Get to the main menu and let Skyrim download all the Anniversary Edition Creation Club content. Now you may proceed with downloading and setting up the modlist. 

## Downloading the modlist
This modlist was built using Wabbajack. To install it on your machine, you must first download Wabbajack here: 
https://www.wabbajack.org/

If you are able to, please support the Wabbajack developers on their patreon: 
https://www.patreon.com/user?u=11907933

Once you have Wabbajack installed and the .wabbajack file downloaded from this github, open Wabbajack, and select "install from drive". There are multiple fields here. First, "Target Modlist" should be pointed towards Peerim.wabbajack. "Modlist Installation Location" should be an empty folder. Wabbajack will wipe any files that may be in the folder already, so BE SURE THIS IS AN EMPTY FOLDER. "Resource Download Location" should be filled out by wabbajack automatically. 

Once these are filled out, press the play button. Wabbajack will begin downloading the modlist. A browser window will open and you must click download for each mod (unfortunately the only way to automate this process is to pay for a nexus premium account). 

## Running Mod Organizer 2

In the "Modlist Installation Location" folder, there will be a portable instance of Mod Organizer 2. If you aren't familiar with Mod Organizer 2, the program has tutorials included and there are guides and documentation on their website: https://www.modorganizer.org/

Once you've started this portable instance of Mod Organizer 2 (you may wish to create a shortcut to your desktop, start menu, or pin it to your taskbar), make sure you have Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64) set as an executable and run it through Mod Organizer 2. If you see an abomination on the Skyrim main menu and not the normal logo, you're all set! Happy pissing pvpJug
